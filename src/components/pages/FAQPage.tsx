    question: "How do I choose the perfect luxury perfume for me?",
    answer: "Choosing the perfect luxury perfume involves understanding your preferences and lifestyle. Start by identifying your preferred fragrance families - floral, oriental, woody, or fresh. Consider your skin chemistry, as perfumes react differently on each person. Test fragrances on your skin and wear them for a few hours to experience the full development. Our expert consultants can guide you through this process, helping you find your signature scent that reflects your personality and lifestyle."

  },
  {
    question: "What is your return and exchange policy?",
    answer: "We offer a 30-day return policy for all unopened and unused products in their original packaging.

  },
  {
    question: "How long do your luxury perfumes last?",
    answer: "Our luxury perfumes are formulated for exceptional longevity. Victoria Nocturne lasts up to 18 hours on the skin, while our other fragrances provide 8-12 hours of wear. The longevity depends on factors like skin type, climate, and application method. We recommend applying to pulse points and using our matching body products to enhance longevity. Our fragrances are designed to evolve beautifully throughout the day, maintaining their sophisticated character."
  },
  {
    question: "Are your perfumes suitable for sensitive skin?",
    answer: "Yes, all Elixir Victoria fragrances are formulated with skin-friendly ingredients and undergo rigorous testing for sensitivity. We use high-quality, hypoallergenic ingredients and avoid common irritants. However, we recommend testing on a small area first if you have very sensitive skin. Our fragrances are alcohol-based but contain moisturizing agents to prevent dryness. We also offer fragrance-free alternatives for those with extreme sensitivities."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I layer different Elixir Victoria fragrances?",

You can layer Victoria Nocturne with our body care products for enhanced longevity, or combine different fragrances to create your unique scent profile. We recommend starting with lighter fragrances as a base and adding stronger notes on top. Our expert consultants can guide you through the perfect layering combinations for your style."
  },
